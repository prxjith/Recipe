I have submitted my partial work only. The website doesn't actually work and I am still working on the fix, but the UI should to good to go, only problem is that the recipes are not getting displayed.

How to run: Open the files on vs code, and save them all under a folder. Then open the index.html file from file explorer using any browser to run.
